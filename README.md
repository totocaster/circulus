Circulus is a template for ver good, minimal, yet beautifully designed
static blog engine — [toto][]. I created this template for my personal
blog, but then decided to open-source it as-well.

Automatic Image Footnoting
--------------------------

Circulus has a very simple but handy feature when rendering images. If
you provide alternative text to image-link markdown in you post like
this: `![Text Here](http://link-to.your/image.png)`, Circulus will
print-out that alternative text as a footnote for image automatically,
so you keep your markdown free of html.

Licence and Contribution
------------------------

You are free to use this theme for personal or commercial use, just
leave the attribution to GitHub repo in the bottom of the template.

You are also free to fork repo and make any changes, ones that I’ll like
will be pushed to my branches too. Thanks for the interest.

Happy blogging!
